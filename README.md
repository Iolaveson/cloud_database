# Overview

My program is an azure database and most of it is handled inside portal.azure.com I made a database which stores all of the data inside azures cloud database system. To create a database in azure you will need to make an account. The first month is free unless you are a student then you can get a free service as long as you renew each year.

I wrote this software to explore the ultility of azure and to find out how it works.
